# Repository instructions — MinimalApi.Endpoints

Scope: repository (MinimalApi.Endpoints)

Purpose: Provide high-level guidance and guardrails for Copilot Chat and agents working in this repo.

Guidelines:
- Language & style
  - Primary language: C# (Minimal APIs). Use idiomatic C# and prefer explicit async/await for IO-bound operations.
  - Enable nullable reference types for new files and prefer simple, readable APIs.
  - Follow .editorconfig and the existing repo formatting rules. If none exist, follow default dotnet conventions.
- Testing
  - Add unit tests for business logic and integration tests for endpoints. New features should include tests.
  - Run tests locally and in CI before opening PRs.
- Security & secrets
  - Never commit secrets, credentials, or private keys. Use GitHub Secrets and environment variables for secrets.
  - Validate and sanitize external input for all endpoints.
- Dependencies
  - Prefer well-maintained, permissively licensed libraries. Add dependency upgrades via separate PRs and include changelogs.
- CI / PRs
  - Keep PRs small and focused. Include a descriptive title and a short summary of changes and testing performed.
- Misc
  - If making breaking changes, document migration steps in the PR description.

Examples:
- "Add an integration test for GET /health that asserts 200 OK and expected JSON payload."
